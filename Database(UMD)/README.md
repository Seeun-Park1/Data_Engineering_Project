# UMD Men’s Soccer Team Attendance Impact Analysis

## 📋 Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between audience attendance and the performance of the UMD Men's Soccer Team from 2021 to 2023. Using SQL, we explored how attendance affects performance metrics such as goals, shots, and win rates.

## 📊 Key Insights
- Higher audience attendance correlates with increased offensive performance (more goals and shots).
- Certain opponents attract significantly higher attendance rates, which may impact match outcomes.

## 🛠️ SQL Queries
The following SQL queries were used to derive insights:
1. How do penalties vary based on different ranges of attendance?
2. What is the relationship between the number of attendance and goals & shots?
3. What is the relationship between the number of attendance and saves?
4. Which opponents draw the top 5 highest audience numbers?
5. What are the game outcomes (win/loss) when the attendance exceeds the average per date?
